This is a test prompt designed to excercise display elements of
Henri. Please return the following:

* A Markdown table
* A Rust function
* A Go function

Then lets test some tool calls:

* Use bash to list the directory
* Read Cargo.toml
* Use the built-in grep tool to search for a pattern
* Find all files in this project ending in .md
* Edit a Rust file, adding lines, removing lines and changing a line
* Undo the edit
