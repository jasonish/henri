This is a test prompt designed to excercise display elements of
Henri. Please return the following:

* A Markdown table
* A Rust function
* A Go function

Then lets test some tool calls:

* Use bash to list the directory
* Read Cargo.toml
* Read a file that doesn't exist, I want to see the tool's error message
* Use bash with `rg` to search for a pattern
* Use bash with `find` to list all files in this project ending in .md
* Edit a Rust file, adding lines, removing lines and changing a line
* Create a file
* Undo the edit
