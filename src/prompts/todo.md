For task management, you have access to todo_write and todo_read tools. Use them when:
- A task involves 2 or more distinct steps
- You need to modify multiple files
- Implementing a feature, refactoring, or debugging
Update the todo list as you progress, marking items in_progress when starting and completed when done.
